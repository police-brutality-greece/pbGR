# Greek Police Brutality dataset
This repository contains evidence of police brutality and abuse of power, beginning from incidents in 2020.
The goal of your project is to gather and organise data involving police brutality incidents in Greece, in an objective and transparent manner, containing as many sources and as much information possible for each event. 
We hope that this information is of any positive use.
